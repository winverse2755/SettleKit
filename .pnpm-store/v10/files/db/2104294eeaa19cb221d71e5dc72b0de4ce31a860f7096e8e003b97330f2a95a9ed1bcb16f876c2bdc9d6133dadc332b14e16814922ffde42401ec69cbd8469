# @circle-fin/bridge-kit

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- **Monad support**: Bridge Kit now supports Monad mainnet and testnet. You can include Monad in cross-chain USDC transfer flows without additional configuration or changes to existing integrations.

- **Automatic re-attestation for fast transfers**: When retrying a failed CCTP v2 fast transfer, the kit now automatically detects if the mint failed due to an expired attestation and triggers re-attestation. This eliminates manual intervention when attestations expire before the mint transaction completes.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Add optional filtering to `getSupportedChains()` method to filter chains by type (EVM, Solana) and network (mainnet/testnet)

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- **Enhanced bridge estimate response**: `EstimateResult` now includes `token`, `amount`, `source`, `destination` fields to provide complete transfer information alongside cost estimates.
- Export error handling utilities and constants.

New exports include:

- Error type guards: isKitError, isBalanceError, isOnchainError, isRpcError, isNetworkError, isRetryableError, isFatalError
- Error constants: BalanceError, OnchainError, RpcError, NetworkError, InputError
- Utility: getErrorCode, getErrorMessage

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add computeFee function to CustomFeePolicy that receives human-readable amounts (e.g., '100' for 100 USDC), deprecate calculateFee which receives smallest-unit amounts
- Enhanced decimal format validation to standardize on strict dot (.) decimal separators. Amount, maxFee, and customFee fields now use a unified dot-decimal format. Supported examples include "1000.50" and "1.5"
- Introduce the `BridgeChain` enum and `BridgeChainIdentifier` type to restrict chain selection to only CCTPv2-supported chains. This provides IDE autocomplete limited to valid bridge chains and ensures that passing an unsupported chain triggers a compile-time error.

### Patch Changes

- Updated BridgeKit to return `BridgeResults` in human readable units for `bridge()` and `retry()`. For example, when printing out the results of a `kit.bridge()` call with 1 USDC, the result's `amount` attribute will now show `'1.0'` instead of `'1000000'`.
- Validation errors now use standardized error codes for consistent error handling. All validation failures return the same `KitError` structure as other SDK errors.

  **Migration:** If you're catching validation errors, update your error handling:
  - Check `error.code === 1098` instead of `instanceof ValidationError`
  - Access details via `error.cause?.trace?.validationErrors` instead of `error.errors`

  The legacy `ValidationError` class remains available for backward compatibility.

- Documented the exact custom-fee flow across Bridge Kit’s README and JSDoc.
  Clarified that kit-level and per-transfer custom fees are added to the transfer debit before CCTPv2 runs.

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Fixed bug where tokens could be burned when bridging to unsupported chains, and improved error messages to clearly show which chains are supported.

  **What's Fixed:**
  - **Prevents fund loss**: Bridge operations now fail immediately if your adapter doesn't support the source or destination chain, **before** any tokens are approved or burned. Previously, tokens could be burned on the source chain before discovering the destination chain was unsupported, requiring manual recovery.
  - **Better error messages**: When you attempt to use an unsupported chain, the error now clearly lists all chains your adapter supports, making it easy to pick an alternative:
    ```
    Invalid chain 'Linea Sepolia': Not supported by this adapter.
    It supports 17 chains: Arbitrum, Base, Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, ...
    ```
  - **Correct error codes**: Chain validation errors now use the correct `INVALID_CHAIN` error code instead of `UNSUPPORTED_ROUTE`, making it easier to handle errors programmatically.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix CommonJS compatibility by correcting file extensions and package exports. This resolves a "ReferenceError: require is not defined" error that occurred when using packages in CommonJS projects with ts-node.

- Fixes a bug where the `recipientAddress` field in the `to` parameter was not being properly propagated to the underlying CCTP v2 provider. This caused custom recipient addresses to be ignored during cross-chain USDC transfers, resulting in funds being minted to the signer's address instead of the intended recipient.

  With this fix, when you specify a `recipientAddress` in the `to` parameter, the Bridge Kit now correctly passes it through to the provider, ensuring funds are minted to the correct address.

  **Example usage** (no changes needed if already using this pattern):

  ```typescript
  await kit.bridge({
    from: { adapter: sourceAdapter, chain: 'Ethereum' },
    to: {
      adapter: destAdapter,
      chain: 'Base',
      recipientAddress: '0x...', // Now properly respected
    },
    amount: '10',
    token: 'USDC',
  })
  ```

  **No breaking changes** - existing code without `recipientAddress` continues to work unchanged. This fix only affects transfers where you explicitly provide a custom recipient address.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Add automatic HTTP request tracking for analytics and debugging. The kit now automatically registers itself when the module loads, enabling Circle to track kit usage and identify issues. Applications can optionally set an external prefix using the new `setExternalPrefix` function to identify themselves in request analytics. All HTTP requests from the kit will include user agent information in the format: `[app/version] bridge-kit/version (runtime)`. This feature requires no code changes for existing users.

### Patch Changes

- Standardize `maxFee` parameter to accept human-readable values. The `maxFee` parameter in `BridgeConfig` now correctly accepts human-readable token amounts (e.g., `"1"` for 1 USDC, `"0.5"` for 0.5 USDC), matching the behavior of `customFee.value`. This resolves an undocumented inconsistency in the API. If you were previously passing values in smallest units, update to human-readable format: use `"1"` instead of `"1000000"` for 1 USDC.
- Complete CCTP v2 chain support exports

  Ensures all 35 chains with CCTP v2 support are properly exported from the `chains` entry point. This fix adds previously missing chain definitions including Codex, HyperEVM, Ink, Plume, Sei, Sonic, Unichain, WorldChain, and XDC networks (both mainnet and testnet variants where applicable).

- Add support for Arc Testnet chain definition. Arc is Circle's EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain designed for stablecoin finance and asset
  tokenization, featuring USDC as the native gas token and sub-second finality via the Malachite BFT consensus engine.
- Fix support for developer-controlled address context. Bridge operations now correctly accept an explicit `address` field in the context, allowing developer-controlled adapters to specify which address to use for operations. Previously, this field was incorrectly rejected at runtime.
- Update Sonic Testnet chain definition to canonical network. The `SonicTestnet` chain definition now points to the official Sonic Testnet (chainId: 14601) instead of the deprecated Sonic Blaze Testnet (chainId: 57054). The RPC endpoint has been updated to `https://rpc.testnet.soniclabs.com`, the display name simplified to "Sonic Testnet", and the USDC contract address updated to the new deployment.

  **Breaking Changes:**
  - **Chain ID:** 57054 → 14601
  - **RPC Endpoint:** `https://rpc.blaze.soniclabs.com` → `https://rpc.testnet.soniclabs.com`
  - **USDC Address:** `0xA4879Fed32Ecbef99399e5cbC247E533421C4eC6` → `0x0BA304580ee7c9a980CF72e55f5Ed2E9fd30Bc51`

  **Migration:** If you were using `SonicTestnet`, your application will automatically connect to the new network upon upgrading. Any accounts, contracts, or transactions on the old Blaze testnet (chainId: 57054) will need to be recreated on the new testnet.
